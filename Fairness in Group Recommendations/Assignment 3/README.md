| [baseline_exp.ipynb](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/baseline_exp.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook, it shows the execution of the Experiments for Sequential Group Recommendations, following the "Baseline" approach |
| [custom_exp.ipynb](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/custom_exp.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook, it shows the execution of the Experiments for Sequential Group Recommendations, following the "Custom" approach |
| [dataset_processing.py](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/dataset_processing.py) | Python file, it contains the implementation of the process that splits the full Dataset and then enriches the "current" Dataset after each Iteration |
| [evaluate.py](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/evaluate.py) | Python file, it contains the implementation of a function that computes the User Satisfaction related to the Group Recommendations |
| [group.py](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/group.py) | Python file, it contains the implementations of the Aggregation Functions (Average, Least Misery, Alpha-Hybrid) for the predicted Scores, the 'Update Alpha MoM' (core of the 'Custom' Approach) function and the 'Group Recommendation' Function |
| [predict.py](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/predict.py) | Python file, it contains the implementation of the Prediction Function, which exploits the Similarity between Users to recommend a "new" Item to a given User |
| [similarity.py](https://github.com/DecioXXIV/ATCS-Assignments/blob/main/Fairness%20in%20Group%20Recommendations/Assignment%203/similarity.py) | Python file, it contains the implementation of the Pearson Similarity Function |
